This looks good to me - except two little code styling things to run:

A) `php-cs-fixer fix --verbose --diff` (once you have `php-cs-fixer` installed - you could even temporarily `composer require` it locally into this repo then just not commit the composer changes)

B) `bin/update_readme` - to regenerate part of the README

Cheers!
